# shakespeares-monkeys
A simple webpage that generates random strings of text and compares them to shakespeare quotes. Hosted [here](https://candiceevemiller.github.io/shakespeares-monkeys/).

Work in progress. Want to refactor to generate text server-side rather than client-side and keep track of best generation thus far and give it nicer styling.
